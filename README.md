# STEpisodeOrange
 An addon for [SuperTux](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/).

# How to use:
**As of currently you will need to install a special build of SuperTux to use Episode Orange.**

* Download [this build of SuperTux](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/actions/runs/3697107500) that has Resource packs via the artifacts.

* Download this addon as a `.zip`

* Go to `%appdata%/supertux2/addons` and put the zip file in.

**Alternatively you could:**

* Make sure you're on a nightly build.

* Copy the SuperTux data directory and save it for later.

* Extract Episode Orange in the data directory. (Not the one you copied.) (also dont forget to move `Levels/Episode_Orang` to `%appdata%/supertux/supertux2/Levels`)

If you followed the steps correctly you should be able to use this version of Episode Orange.
